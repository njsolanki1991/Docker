# Docker Basics  

Docker is a software for deploying and running containerized applications.  
It solves problems using **containers**, which are isolated groups of processes.  

Docker is similar to a virtual machine, but VMs are slower and have their own OS, while Docker shares the host OS.

## Basic Docker Commands  

### 1. Verify Docker Installation  
To check if Docker is installed correctly, run:  
```sh
docker run hello-world
```
If successful, you will see the message:  
> "Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly."

---

### 2. Pull an Image  
To pull the **BusyBox** image from the Docker registry and install it on your system:  
```sh
docker pull busybox
```

---

### 3. View Downloaded Images  
To list all images available on your system:  
```sh
docker images
```

---

### 4. Run a Container  
To create and run a container using the **BusyBox** image:  
```sh
docker run busybox
```
**Note:**  
If nothing happens in the command prompt, that means Docker created the container and ran the command. Since no command was specified, the container was created and exited immediately.
